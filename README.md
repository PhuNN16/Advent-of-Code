Advent of Code is a website that posts fun coding puzzle everyday between the days of December 1st to December 25th. Generally the puzzle gets more difficult every day. Each puzzle has 2 parts, and you earn a gold star for each part you complete along with points for your overall ranking. If you were among the first 100 people to finish part one or the first 100 to finish part 2, you can earn extra points. So speed is an important aspect in determining your rank on the leaderboards.

These are my code for all the problems I have tried.

 Note: Some of them are not solved
