"# Advent-of-Code"

Advent of Code is a website that posts fun coding puzzle everyday between the days of December 1st to December 25th. Generally the puzzle gets more difficult every day. Each puzzle has 2 parts, and you earn a gold star for each part you complete. There is also rankings based on how fast you finished. If you were among the first 100 people to finish part one or the first 100 to finish part 2, you can earn extra points. 

Here are the code for all the puzzles I attempted. There were some problems that I have attempted but have still been unable to solve. Those were Day 10 part 2 Day 12, Day 13 part 2, Day 17, Day 18, Day 19 part 2, and everything after day 19.

As the goal was to try to solve the puzzle as soon as possible, the code might not be organized. I have reorganized some of the days but not all of them.
