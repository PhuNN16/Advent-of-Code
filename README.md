"# Advent-of-Code"

Advent of Code is a website that posts fun coding puzzle everyday between the days of December 1st to December 25th. Generally the puzzle gets more difficult every day. Each puzzle has 2 parts, and you earn a gold star for each part you complete along with points for your overall ranking. If you were among the first 100 people to finish part one or the first 100 to finish part 2, you can earn extra points. So speed is an important aspect in determining your rank on the leaderboards.

Here are the code for all the puzzles I attempted. There were some problems that I have attempted but have still been unable to solve. Those were Day 10 part 2 Day 12, Day 13 part 2, Day 17, Day 18, Day 19 part 2, and everything after day 19.
